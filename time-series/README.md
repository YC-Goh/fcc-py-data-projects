## Note

To see the tests in action to verify the pass status, download all these files into one folder (Do not fork or `git` anything! That is a complete waste of time!), load an environment with `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`, then use `python3 main.py`.

This is a temporary alternative to `replit.com` because for whatever reason it is near impossible to get `main.py` to run there.
The environment initialisation command there takes forever to run and it is not guaranteed to complete successfully.
I variously either get `ModuleNotFoundError` for `pandas` or `matplotlib`.
While I can install them using `pip` in the `shell`, it causes dependency conflicts which results in `main.py` not necessarily running at all.
